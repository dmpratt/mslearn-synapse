# Load Data into a Relational Data Warehouse

Data engineers and data analysts alike have the ability to quickly analyze data stored in Azure Data Lake using a variety of techniques; however, there are times 
when it is more effective and performant to load the data into the Azure Synapse Relational Data Warehouse to gain the performance of the Massively Parallel Performance (MPP)
architecture which provides near-linear scalability and seamlessly connects to the Data Lake with the use of Polybase.

In this lab, you'll use a dedicated SQL pool in Azure Synapse Analytics to transform data in files into physical tables in Azure Synapse Analytics.

This lab will take approximately **20** minutes to complete.

## Before you start

You'll need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) in which you have administrative-level access.

## Provision an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace

You'll need an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace with access to data lake storage. You can use the built-in serverless SQL pool to query files in the data lake.

In this exercise, you'll use a combination of a PowerShell script and an ARM template to provision an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace.

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) at `https://portal.azure.com`.
2. Use the **[\>_]** button to the right of the search bar at the top of the page to create a new Cloud Shell in the Azure portal, selecting a ***PowerShell*** environment and creating storage if prompted. The cloud shell provides a command line interface in a pane at the bottom of the Azure portal, as shown here:

    > **Note**: If you have previously created a cloud shell that uses a *Bash* environment, use the the drop-down menu at the top left of the cloud shell pane to change it to ***PowerShell***.

3. Note that you can resize the cloud shell by dragging the separator bar at the top of the pane, or by using the **&#8212;**, **&#9723;**, and **X** icons at the top right of the pane to minimize, maximize, and close the pane. For more information about using the Azure Cloud Shell, see the [Azure Cloud Shell documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview).

4. In the PowerShell pane, enter the following commands to clone this repo:

    ```
    rm -r dp-000 -f
    git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-synapse dp-000
    ```

5. After the repo has been cloned, enter the following commands to change to the folder for this lab and run the **setup.ps1** script it contains:

    ```
    cd dp-000/Allfiles/Labs/15
    ./setup.ps1
    ```

6. If prompted, choose which subscription you want to use (this will only happen if you have access to multiple Azure subscriptions).
7. When prompted, enter a suitable password to be set for your Azure Synapse SQL pool.

    > **Note**: Be sure to remember this password!

8. Wait for the script to complete - this typically takes around 10 minutes, but in some cases may take longer. While you are waiting, review the [Apache Spark Pool Configurations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-pool-configurations) article in the Azure Synapse Analytics documentation.

## View and Navigate Synapse Worspace
1. After the script has completed, in the Azure portal, go to the dp000-xxxxxxx resource group that it created, and select your Synapse workspace.
2. In the Overview page for your Synapse Workspace, in the Open Synapse Studio card, select Open to open Synapse Studio in a new browser tab; signing in if prompted.
3. On the left side of Synapse Studio, use the ›› icon to expand the menu - this reveals the different pages within Synapse Studio that you’ll use to manage resources and perform data analytics tasks.
4. On the Manage page, select the Apache Spark pools tab and note that a Spark pool with a name similar to **sparkxxxxxxx** has been provisioned in the workspace.
5. On the Data page, view the Linked tab and verify that your workspace includes a link to your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 storage account, which should have a name similar to **synapsexxxxxxx (Primary - datalakexxxxxxx)**.
6. Expand your storage account and verify that it contains a file system container named **files (primary)**.
7. Select the files container, and note that it contains folders named sales and synapse. The synapse folder is used by Azure Synapse, and the sales folder contains the data files you are going to query.
Open the sales folder and the orders folder it contains, and observe that the orders folder contains .csv files for three years of sales data.
***Right-click*** any of the files and select Preview to see the data it contains. Note that the files contain a header row, so you can select the option to display column headers.

## Add content here to create a notebook which will perform a CTAS operation using GUI.

## Delete Azure resources
If you've finished exploring Azure Synapse Analytics, you should delete the resources you've created to avoid unnecessary Azure costs.

1. Close the Synapse Studio browser tab and return to the Azure portal.
2. On the Azure portal, on the **Home** page, select **Resource groups**.
3. Select the **dp000-*xxxxxxx*** resource group for your Synapse Analytics workspace (not the managed resource group), and verify that it contains the Synapse workspace, storage account, and Spark pool for your workspace.
4. At the top of the **Overview** page for your resource group, select **Delete resource group**.
5. Enter the **dp000-*xxxxxxx*** resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**.

    After a few minutes, your Azure Synapse workspace resource group and the managed workspace resource group associated with it will be deleted.
